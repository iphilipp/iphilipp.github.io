      I'm currently a Network Operations Technician at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.spacelink.com/" target="_blank">SpaceLink</a> keeping the internet running and helping people out every day. I recently graduated from

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front (or inside) of a computer</strong>, I'm probably skiing, backpacking, building a mechanical keyboard or another computer.
