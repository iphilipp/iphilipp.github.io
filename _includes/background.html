      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between ideas and results &mdash; combining my technical knowledge with my understanding of good user experiences to make an intuitive product. My goal is to build applications that are reliable and efficient while being engaging and approachable to users.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer</strong>, I'm probably skiing, backpacking, building a mechanical keyboard or putting together another computer.
